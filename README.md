**Performance Evaluation of ML Models for Sonar-based Mine Detection**  



This bachelor thesis focuses on evaluating the performance of various machine learning models—LightGBM, MLP, Random Forest, and KNN—with the aim of classifying underwater objects using sonar frequencies. The project involved assessing the robustness and reliability of these models by comparing their effectiveness on both the original and a modified dataset.

To enhance the dataset, Gaussian mixture noise was introduced, and synthetic values were generated using Gaussian Mixture Models to simulate more challenging scenarios. This augmented dataset was used to evaluate the ability of each machine learning algorithm to handle noisy data and maintain high performance.

The models' performances were measured using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, providing a comprehensive comparison between their effectiveness on the original and modified datasets. This approach helped identify which models are most robust for sonar-based mine detection tasks under varying conditions, with a focus on model reliability and adaptability.

This study provides valuable insights into how noise and data augmentation affect machine learning model performance, ultimately supporting the selection of reliable models for real-world sonar applications.
